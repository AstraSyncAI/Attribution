# AI Agent Attribution Framework

This repository explores critical infrastructure requirements for attributing, monitoring, and governing AI agent actions across organizational boundaries based on the paper ["Infrastructure for AI Agents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10114) by Chan et al.

## The Attribution Crisis

As AI agents become more autonomous and widespread, organizations face a growing crisis:
- Inability to verify the origin and integrity of agents
- No universal standards for agent identification
- Limited capacity to attribute actions to specific agents
- Difficulty establishing compliance across jurisdictional boundaries

## Core Infrastructure Components

This framework proposes essential infrastructure organized in three layers:

### Layer 1: Identity & Attribution
- Agent identifiers and registries
- Identity binding mechanisms
- Certification protocols
- Provenance verification

### Layer 2: Interaction Governance
- Agent communication channels
- Oversight mechanisms
- Inter-agent protocols
- Commitment frameworks

### Layer 3: Response & Remediation
- Incident reporting systems
- Action rollback mechanisms
- Compliance verification
- Auditability protocols

## Technical Implementations

This repository contains reference implementations demonstrating how these infrastructure components can be realized using SOTA technology to create immutable, verifiable attribution records.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, and organizations concerned with AI safety, governance, and compliance infrastructure.
